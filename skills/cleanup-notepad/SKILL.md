# Cleanup Notepad++ Unsaved Tabs

Triage all unsaved "new X" tabs in Notepad++. Read their contents from backup files, determine which are worth saving vs which are ephemeral scratch (temporary pastes, session prompts, AI-generated reference, duplicates of existing files), and save the keepers with descriptive names in logical locations.

## Step 1: Identify currently open unsaved tabs

First, read `C:\Users\blewis\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++\session.xml` to find which "new X" tabs are **currently open** in Notepad++. The session file lists all open tabs with their backup file paths. Only triage tabs listed in the session file — the backup folder may contain stale backups from old sessions that are no longer open.

Then read the corresponding backup files from `C:\Users\blewis\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++\backup\`. Read them all in parallel.

## Step 2: Categorize each file

For each backup file, determine if it should be **saved** or **deleted** by checking:

1. **Is it a temporary paste?** Short snippets pasted for quick viewing/editing (code snippets, expressions, quick references) → DELETE
2. **Is it a session prompt?** Prompts written to kick off AI sessions, where the resulting work already exists → DELETE
3. **Is it AI-generated reference output?** Content generated by AI tools (BlueGPT, Claude, etc.) where the insights have already been incorporated into project files → DELETE
4. **Is it duplicated by existing files?** Search **specific relevant project directories** (not all of `~/dev/`) using Grep/Glob to check if the content already lives in a proper file → DELETE
5. **Is it work that's been fully completed?** Review plans, task lists, comment drafts where all items are done and tracked in project files → DELETE
6. **Does it contain unique, unreplicated content?** Planning notes with open questions, personal writing, incomplete task descriptions, meeting notes → SAVE
7. **Does it describe work that hasn't been done yet?** Task descriptions, TODO lists for unfinished work → SAVE

For files you're unsure about, err on the side of SAVE.

## Step 3: Present findings to user

Show a clear summary table organized as:
- **DELETE** group: tab name, brief content description, reason it can go (what existing file supersedes it, or why it's ephemeral)
- **SAVE** group: tab name, brief content description, proposed filename and location

Choose save locations based on **existing** directory structure. Always prefer saving into directories that already exist — do not create new top-level directories. Use `ls` to verify a directory exists before proposing it. Look for relevant project directories the content belongs in. Common locations:
- `C:\Users\blewis\dev\` subtrees for project-related content
- `C:\Users\blewis\docs\` for personal documents
- Match the file extension to the content type (.md for structured docs, .txt for plain notes, .qml for QML code, etc.)

**Wait for user approval before saving anything.**

## Step 4: Save approved files

Write each approved file to its destination. Confirm what was saved and remind the user they can now close all "new X" tabs in Notepad++.

## Notes

- Backup files that can't be read (not yet flushed to disk) should be flagged for the user to check manually
- Already-saved tabs (with real file paths in session.xml, not "new X") don't need triage — they're already on disk
- After the user closes tabs in Notepad++, the stale backup files are cleaned up automatically by Notepad++ — no need to delete them manually
